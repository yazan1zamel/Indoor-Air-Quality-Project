This folder contains time series data of monitored mechanical ventilation equipment, estimates of air infiltration rate, and overall air exchange rate. There is one csv file for each of the 70 homes.Exhaust fan airflows were monitored minute by minute using anemometer data loggers and motor sensors. In homes with a supply fan provide the whole house mechanical ventilation (001, 003, 009, and 010), the supply fan airflow rate was not measured and the rated airflow rate was assumed in the calculation of total ventilation rates.  

In all homes except 003, 005, 006, and 029, the DeltaQ Test was performed to measure the envelope and duct leakage. Air infiltration airflows were calculated using the measured envelope air leakage flow coefficient and pressure exponent for each home, determined as part of the DeltaQ Test, and using stack and wind coefficients following the ASHRAE Fundamentals Enhanced Model. Wind data were obtained from the nearest weather station. Indoor and outdoor temperatures were monitored onsite. Photos of the house and surroundings were reviewed to determine the appropriate shelter class: either 4 (urban building on larger lots where sheltering obstacles are more than one building height away) or 5 (shelter produced by buildings or other structures that are closer than one house height away). 

Total ventilation rate was calculated using a superposition adjustment to account for the sub-additivity of unbalanced mechanical airflows with air infiltration. Airflows were translated to air exchange rates using the estimated house volume, calculated from the estimated house-average ceiling height and floor area recorded by the field team. The field team measured ceiling heights in the great room, kitchen, living room, dining room, bedrooms, and other parts of the house.A visual review of the airflow data was conducted by comparing the overall house ventilation rate, individual fan airflow rates, and motor status of monitored fans. Several houses had fans with multiple modes of operation, such as caused by multiple bath fans with intermittent controls, but each operating on a different schedule. The following column headers are used. Files for each home has a different number of columns depending on available data that was monitored.BA1_CFM = Master bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]BA2_CFM = 2nd bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]BA3_CFM = 3rd bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]BA4_CFM = 4th bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]BA5_CFM = 5th bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]BA6_CFM = 6th bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]TO1_CFM = Toilet room in master bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]TO2_CFM = 2nd toilet room exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]TO3_CFM = 3rd toilet room exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]SW1_CFM = Shower stall in master bathroom exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]CDR_CFM = Clothes dryer exhaust airflow [ cfm ]. This was measured only in a few of the homes. An airflow rate of 125 cfm is assumed if not measured. LAU_CFM = Laundry room exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]LAU2_CFM = 2nd Laundry room exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]RHD_CFM = Range hood or over-the-range (OTR) microwave exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]. For OTR, this was calculated using the unadjusted airflow rate. See /Home_Equipment_Data/ for the adjusted OTR airflow rate.  RHD2_CFM = 2nd Range hood exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]KIT_CFM = Kitchen exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_Exhaust = Total exhaust fan airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_Supply = Rated supply fan airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_MVbalance = Balance mechanical ventilation airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_MVunbalance = Unbalance mechanical ventilation airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_Infiltration = Infiltration airflow [ cfm ]QCFM_Total = Total ventilation airflow [ cfm ]ACH = Air changes per hour [ 1/h ]
