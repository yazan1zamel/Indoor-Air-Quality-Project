This folder contains time-resolved air quality data, including estimated PM2.5 as measured by photometry (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (FRM), temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH). Data also included T and RH measured at supply air register(s) in 25 homes. There are 70 csv files, one for each home.  DATA ISSUES-----------We note two issues with the data reported by the GrayWolf / Shinyei Multimode Formaldehyde monitors (FMM): [1] NO2 interference, and [2] below detection limit (<LOD). Potentially affected FMM data were identified as events in which there was a sharp, temporary drop of formaldehyde concentrations corresponding with direct measurement of a substantial NO2 peak or, in the absence of direct NO2 data, evidence of substantial gas cooking burner use. The change in formaldehyde was generally a drop of 10ppb (or to <LOD) from one 30-min reading to the next followed by a return to the previous values, both corresponding in time to evidence of NO2 from the NO2 data or cooking burner temperature sensors. Substantial NO2 emission events were identified by sharp increases in baseline-adjusted NO2 (using a baseline adjustment algorithm that is not included in the dataset) followed by exponential decay. The initial screen was an NO2 rise > 20ppb. When NO2 data were unavailable (or unclear), we checked the cooking burner temperature data to assess burner use.- Formaldehyde data that showed interference with NO2 emitted indoors from cooking were identified by visual review and removed from the adjusted data series. When this occurred, the value of "NO2gb" was entered in the data flag column. - Values of "<LOD" (<10 ppb) reported by the standard GrayWolf software were replaced with 7.3 ppb, which was the mean value of all measurements below 10 ppb for monitors deployed at the main indoor location in 12 homes that had special software to support estimated measurements below 10 ppb and a substantial number of measurements below 10 ppb. (There were 13 other homes with data downloaded using the special software, but many had few readings below 10 ppb.) In addition, the following issues were identified at the stage of draft final data review:- The outdoor PM time series is noisy at 1-minute resolution. When using these data, it is recommended to average over at least 10 minutes.- One data series (House 122, Main Indoor Location) had CO2 readings below the measurement uncertainty of the instrument (i.e., below 350 ppm).- All NO2 data were subject to baseline variability, presumably caused by temperature variations. The NO2 sensor is an electrochemical device, and the baseline is sensitive to temperature changes. NO2 data have *NOT* been adjusted for this baseline shift.- In a few homes the NO2 time series varied at high time resolution (very noisy) and were deemed unusable.- The indoor PM time series errors seem to have manifested with an error rate of ~0.1% with some of the data. This was likely due to software issues during the instrument download. It only affected some of the houses, and when it did it manifested as mistranslated characters. For example a comma could be replaced by a zero (or some other valid ASCII character), or a number replaced by a zero. Finding the errors was a tedious semi-manual process with different research team members employing different tools and methods to find / resolve. As a final check all of the raw data files were bulk imported passing over errors and plotted against the penultimate version in the data tables. This illustrated gross copy / paste and time adjustment errors. These problems were fixed using a script that identified lines with extra commas allowing for efficient manual correction. The next step was to look for valid time conversions, and the time difference  between data points. Time errors included dates shifted by 10 or 100 years, and similar replacements in the hour or minute locations. Concentration values are written in a 0 buffered 7 character format, e.g. 5 is represented as 0000005. There were errors when one of these zeros was replaced with a number resulting in spurious high numbers.The following column headers are used.
