The dataset contains the most relevant information collected about the 70 houses and their mechanical equipment, results of the participant survey, results of air leakage and airflow measurements at the homes, pollutant concentrations measured by time-integrated passive samplers inside and outside of the home, usage of cooktop and oven, external door open state, and time-series or air pollutants and environmental indicators measured within and outside of the houses.

Organization of Dataset 

Airflow
This folder contains time series data of monitored mechanical ventilation equipment, estimates of air infiltration rate, and overall air exchange rate.  There is one csv file for each home. See HENGH_Airflow_ReadMe for more details. 
Ambient_PM
This folder contains a summary of PM2.5 data reported by one or more ambient air monitoring stations nearest to each study home. There is one EXCEL file containing PM2.5 data reported from up to three closest regulatory monitoring sites. A composite estimate of ambient PM2.5 was calculated for each home using an inverse distance weighing method.  
Home_Equipment_Data
This folder contains data about the house, including basic characteristics, air leakage test results, and measured airflow rates of mechanical ventilation equipment. There is one EXCEL file containing the data for all homes. The EXCEL file has ReadMe information about the data provided and a note about data quality issue concerning exhaust airflow measurements of over-the-range microwaves.   
IAQ_Monitoring
This folder contains time-resolved air quality data, including estimated PM2.5 as measured by photometry (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (FRM), temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH). There is one csv file of 1-minute time-series data for each home. See HENGH_IAQ_Monitoring_ReadMe for data header definitions and data issues. 
IAQ_Sample
This folder contains the results of time-integrated air quality samples, including passive measurements of formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and PM2.5 gravimetric filter measurements. There is one EXCEL file containing all data. Detail information about chemical analysis of air samples are provided elsewhere in the journal paper and report. 
Occupant_Activity
This folder contains tabulated information provided by study participants from their daily activity logs. There is one EXCEL file containing data transcribed by a staff member, which was independently spot checked by another staff to confirm accuracy. The PDF file is the daily activity log used. 
Occupant_Survey
This folder contains results of a survey about the occupants, their general activities related to ventilation and IAQ satisfaction, completed by study participants. There is one EXCEL file containing data transcribed by a staff member. Two homes did not complete surveys; these homes have "No survey" in each data file. Questions for the occupant surveys are provided in MS Word and PDF formats. 
State_Monitoring
This folder contains time series data of cooking burners monitored with iButton temperature sensors and open/close status of external (mostly patio) doors monitored with state sensors. There is one csv file for each home. See HENGH_State_Monitoring_ReadMe for more details.
